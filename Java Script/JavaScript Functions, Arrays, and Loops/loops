The For Loop:-
A for loop contains three expressions separated by ; inside the parentheses:
an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.
a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against— if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.
an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

Nested Loops:-
When we have a loop running inside another loop, we call that a nested loop. One use for a nested for loop is to compare the elements in two arrays. For each round of the outer for loop, the inner for loop will run completely.

Do...While Statements
In some cases, you want a piece of code to run at least once and then loop based on a specific condition after its initial run. This is where the do...while statement comes in.

Loops perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code that process manually every time.

A nested for loop is a loop inside another loop
while loops allow for different types of stopping conditions
Stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops.
do...while loops run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution
The break keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block
