There are only seven fundamental data types in JavaScript, and six of those are the primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. With the seventh type, objects, we open our code to more complex possibilities. We can use JavaScript objects to model real-world things, like a basketball, or we can use objects to build the data structures that make the web possible.

At their core, JavaScript objects are containers storing related data and functionality, but that deceptively simple task is extremely powerful in practice. 

Creating Object Literals
Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type. We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:
let fasterShip  ={
  'Fuel Type':'Turbo Fuel',
  color: 'silver'};
