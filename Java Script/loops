The For Loop:-
A for loop contains three expressions separated by ; inside the parentheses:
an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.
a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.
an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

The for loop syntax looks like this:
for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
}
Now, make your own! Create a program that loops from 5 to 10 and logs each number to the console.
for (let count=5; count < 11;count ++){
  console.log(count)
}

Looping in Reverse:-
// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let count = 3; count >=0; count --){console.log(count)}

Looping through Arrays:-
const vacationSpots = ['Bali', 'Paris', 'Tulum'];
// Write your code below
for (let i = 0; i < vacationSpots.length; i++){
  console.log('I would love to visit '+vacationSpots[i]);
}

Nested Loops:-
When we have a loop running inside another loop, we call that a nested loop. One use for a nested for loop is to compare the elements in two arrays. For each round of the outer for loop, the inner for loop will run completely.
