Attributes:- Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
Here, class is the attribute name and "editor-note" is the attribute value. 
The class attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to target the element with style information and other things.

""<p class = "editor-note"> "My cat is very grumpy"</p>""

Divs:- One of the most popular elements in HTML is the <div> element. <div> is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections. 
These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.

Paragraphs (<p>) contain a block of plain text.
<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.

The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis.

Unordered Lists:-
In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read list.

In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (<ul>) to create a list of items in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.

The <ul> element should not hold raw text and won’t automatically format raw text into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag. The <li> or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.

Ordered Lists:-
Ordered lists (<ol>) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.

You can create the ordered list with the <ol> tag and then add individual list items to the list using <li> tags.

Images:-
The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both opening and closing tags, but the <img> tag is a self-closing tag. 
Note that the end of the <img> tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash — both will render properly.

Image Alts:- 
Part of being an exceptional web developer is making your site accessible to users of all backgrounds. 
In order to make the Web more inclusive, 
we need to consider what happens when assistive technologies such as screen readers come across image tags.
The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images on our sites. 
The alt attribute can be added to the image tag just like the src attribute. 
The value of alt should be a description of the image.

Videos:-
In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <img> tag, the <video> tag requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. 
Unlike the <img> tag however, the <video> element requires an opening and a closing tag.

Head:-
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page.
A browser’s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.

Linking to Other Web Pages
One of the powerful aspects of HTML (and the Internet), is the ability to link to other web pages.

Linking At Will:-
Thankfully, HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, 
it’s possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the <img> element with an <a> element.

Linking to Same Page:-
When users visit our site, we want them to be able to click a link and have the page automatically scroll to a specific section.
An id is especially helpful for organizing content belonging to a div!
