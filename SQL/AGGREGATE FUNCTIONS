AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS:-Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.
COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column

Count:- The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the COUNT() function.
COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fake_apps WHERE price = 0

Sum:-SQL makes it easy to add all values in a particular column using SUM().
SUM() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.
SELECT SUM(downloads) FROM fake_apps;

Max / Min:-The MAX() and MIN() functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.
SELECT MAX(price) FROM fake_apps;
SELECT MIN(downloads) FROM fake_apps;

Average:-SQL uses the AVG() function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.
SELECT AVG(price) FROM fake_apps;

Round:-By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding. 
We can make the result table easier to read using the ROUND() function.
ROUND() function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:
a column name
an integer
It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.
Here, AVG(price) is the 1st argument and 2 is the 2nd argument because we want to round it to two decimal places:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM fake_apps;

Group By I:-Oftentimes, we will want to calculate an aggregate for data with certain characteristics.
SELECT year,
   AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.
The GROUP BY statement comes after any WHERE statements, but before ORDER BY or LIMIT.

Group By II:-
