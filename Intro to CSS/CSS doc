Inline Styles:-it’s possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.
To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. 
After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you’d like applied to that element.
Example:- 
<p style="color: red;">I'm learning to code!</p>
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">I'm learning to code!</p>

The <style> Tag:-HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the <style> element. 
CSS can be written between opening and closing <style> tags. 
To use the <style> element, it must be placed inside of the <head> element.

The .css file:-You can create a CSS file by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css
With a CSS file, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a page without sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file.

Linking the CSS File:-When HTML and CSS code are in separate files, the files must be linked. Otherwise, the HTML file won’t be able to locate the CSS code, and the styling will not be applied.
Example:- <link href="https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">

Tag Name:- CSS can select HTML elements by using an element’s tag name. A tag name is the word (or character) between HTML angle brackets.

Class Name:-CSS is not limited to selecting elements by tag name. HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. 
It’s also possible to select an element by its class attribute.
.title{
  color: teal;
}
Multiple Classes:-Luckily, it’s possible to add more than one class name to an HTML element’s class attribute.
